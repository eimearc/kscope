# Renderer

Renderer is client-side only browser application to render a 3D view of maps.
The input is the map features in an area in GeoJSON format. Renderer is part
of the Kartta Labs suite of applications.

To run a local copy of Renderer make your desired changes in `settings.js` file,
and then run a webserver in the `renderer` directory with your favorite http server application.
One example is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. You can visit the application at http://localhost:8000.
